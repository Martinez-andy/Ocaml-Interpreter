# Ocaml Intepreter

For this project, I built an interpreter for subset of ocaml. The interpreter allows for the creation of local variables and arithmatic operatios such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I implemented the support for theese operators for ints as well as for floating point values. As part of this project I had to go over the semantics
of ocaml and write my code in a way that is consistent with those semantics. The interpreter was written in ocaml.
